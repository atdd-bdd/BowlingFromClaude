# Bowling with Claude

This version of bowling was written by Claude.   The input was a Gherkin extended file, shown in [BowlingFromClaude/bowling.feature at main · atdd-bdd/BowlingFromClaude · GitHub](https://github.com/atdd-bdd/BowlingFromClaude/blob/main/bowling.feature)The Gherkin file includes scenarios that describe domain terms and business rules, as well as the usual Given/When/Then flows.

The  syntax of a Gherkin extended file is described in detail at [GitHub - atdd-bdd/GherkinExecutorBase: This is the base for Gherkin Executor containing Documentation and Examples](https://github.com/atdd-bdd/GherkinExecutorBase). A key aspect is that Data elements specify the data types of every field in stepdef tables.  

That additional information allows Claude to process the file with less ambiquity.
